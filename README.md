## Hi, I’m Kahini 👋

I’m currently a Neuroscience PhD student at Columbia working on
decision-making and cognition using behavioral data,
computational models, and human single-neuron recordings.

My focus is on building tasks, analyses, and models
that capture how people behave, particularly
when decisions are noisy, suboptimal, or context-dependent.

### What I work on
- Decision-making and cognitive control
- Behavioral task design and analysis
- Computational models of choice and learning
- Linking behavior to neural data

### Code on here includes
- Task implementations used in human experiments
- Behavioral analysis and modeling code
- Data validation and preprocessing scripts
- Contributions to larger research toolchains (including prior work on neuroimaging pipelines such as [`xcp_d`](https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00257/123715/XCP-D-A-robust-pipeline-for-the-post-processing-of)

Some repositories have project- or paper-linked names and are kept
stable for reproducibility.

### Tools & languages
Python, R, shell scripting  
Behavioral experiments, modeling, and analysis  
Experience with large research pipelines and collaborative codebases

### Collaboration
I’m happy to collaborate on:
- Decision-making and cognitive experiments
- Behavioral modeling and task design
- Research code that prioritizes clarity and reproducibility
